Forever we remain oblivious to the future,   
lost to the past and enduring our torture.   
Forever we take chances to settle our scores,   
losing some battles and winning some wars.   
Forever praying out loud hoping someone will hear,   
forever crying softly but never shedding a tear.   
Forever exists behind a disguise,   
but the belief in forever keeps our hearts alive.
